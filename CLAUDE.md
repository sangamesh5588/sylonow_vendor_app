## Architecture Overview

### State Management
- **Primary**: Riverpod 2.0 with code generation (`riverpod_annotation`, `riverpod_generator`)
- **Pattern**: AsyncNotifier providers with proper error handling
- **Structure**: Each feature has dedicated providers in `providers/` folder

### Code Organization (Feature-First Architecture)

```

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Routing**: GoRouter with comprehensive auth guards and state-based redirects
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, database, real-time features, and file storage
- **Data Models**: Freezed for immutable data classes with JSON serialization
- **Notifications**: Firebase + OneSignal dual integration with edge function webhooks
- **Image Handling**: Built-in image picker with temporary file cleanup system
- **Authentication**: Phone-based OTP with Google Sign-In fallback

### Data Flow Pattern
1. **Models**: Freezed classes with `fromJson`/`toJson` in `models/`
2. **Services**: Supabase data access in `service/` folder, returns Freezed models
3. **Providers**: AsyncNotifier providers in `providers/` with error handling
4. **Controllers**: UI logic controllers in `controllers/` for complex interactions
5. **Screens**: UI screens consuming providers in `screens/`
6. **Widgets**: Reusable components in `widgets/`

## Code Development Principles
- Always write clean, industry-level, and scalable code
- Maintain code quality and adhere to best practices
- Separate UI and business logic
  - Use Riverpod providers for business logic
  - Create providers to manage logic in UI files
- Maximum code file length: 1000 lines
- UI files should not contain business logic
- Create separate providers for complex interactions
- Use controllers to manage UI logic

## Feature Development Workflow

When creating new features, follow this exact structure from `.cursor/rules/flutter-rules.mdc`:

1. **Create folder structure**: `screens/`, `providers/`, `controllers/`, `models/`, `widgets/`, `service/`
2. **Create Freezed models first**: Define data structures with JSON serialization using `@freezed`
3. **Run code generation**: `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
4. **Implement services**: Supabase data access in `service/` folder returning Freezed models via `fromJson`/`toJson`
5. **Create providers**: AsyncNotifier providers in `providers/` with proper error handling
6. **Build screens**: UI in `screens/` consuming providers
7. **Add controllers**: UI logic controllers in `controllers/` for complex interactions

### Development Principles from Cursor Rules
- Follow feature-first layer approach
- Keep user interface minimal and clean
- Avoid complex code and maintain proper separations
- Always use AsyncNotifier pattern for providers

## Important Configuration

### Supabase Integration
- Configuration in `lib/core/config/supabase_config.dart`
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are critical for data access
- Real-time subscriptions used throughout the app

### Authentication Flow
- Phone-based OTP authentication via Supabase with PKCE flow
- Google Sign-In integration available as fallback
- Comprehensive auth guards in router configuration with `GoRouterRefreshStream`
- Vendor verification workflow: Authentication → Onboarding → Verification → Home
- Auth state managed through `authStateProvider` and `vendorProvider`

### Code Generation Requirements
- Run code generation after model changes: `flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- Freezed models require `@freezed` annotation
- Riverpod providers use `@riverpod` annotation for code generation

### Build System
- Uses automated build script (`build_release.bat`) for release builds
- Includes app icon and splash screen generation
- Supports both APK and AAB output formats
- Configured for core library desugaring (Android API compatibility)

### Notification System (OneSignal + Firebase)
- **OneSignal**: Primary push notification service with edge function integration
- **Firebase**: Backup notification system and analytics
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase functions in `supabase/functions/order-notifications-onesignal/`
- **Database Webhooks**: Automatic order notification triggers via PostgreSQL functions
- **Testing**: Use `./test_onesignal_integration.sh` for comprehensive integration testing

## Development Notes

### State Management Best Practices
- Always use AsyncNotifier for data providers
- Implement proper error handling in all providers
- Use `ref.invalidate()` to refresh data when needed
- Keep UI state separate from business logic

### Navigation Guidelines
- All routes defined in `lib/core/config/router_config.dart`
- Auth guards prevent unauthorized access
- State-based redirects handle complex authentication flows
- Use `context.go()` for navigation, `context.push()` for modal flows

### Performance Considerations
- Automatic temp file cleanup system in place (cleans files older than 1 day)
- Image picker creates temporary files in `temp_images/` directory
- Real-time subscriptions are used judiciously to avoid performance issues

### Testing
- Unit tests: `flutter test`
- Widget tests in `test/widget_test/`
- Integration tests in `test/integration_test/`

### Development Notes
- Uses dependency overrides for `analyzer: ^6.4.1` and `custom_lint_core: ^0.6.0`
- Requires Android SDK 23+ due to core library desugaring
- while changing model file keep in mind that awe are using freexzed so dont edit model file that has .g.dart extention it will auto create when we run dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
