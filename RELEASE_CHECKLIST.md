## Build Commands

### Quick Build (Run the script)
```bash
.\build_release.bat
```

### Manual Build Commands
```bash
# Clean and prepare
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Generate assets
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create

# Build for Play Store (AAB)
flutter build appbundle --release

# Build for direct distribution (APK)
flutter build apk --release
```

## Output Locations

After successful build, you'll find:

- **AAB (Play Store)**: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- **APK (Direct)**: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

## Upload Instructions

### Google Play Store (AAB)
1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Select your app
3. Navigate to "Production" under "Release" section
4. Click "Create new release"
5. Upload the `app-release.aab` file
6. Fill in release notes
7. Review and rollout

### Direct Distribution (APK)
1. Share the `app-release.apk` file
2. Users need to enable "Install from unknown sources"
3. Consider using a distribution platform like Firebase App Distribution

## Version Management

Current version: `1.0.0+1`
- Version name: `1.0.0` (user-visible)
- Version code: `1` (internal, increment for each release)

To update version:
1. Edit `pubspec.yaml`: `version: 1.0.1+2`
2. Rebuild the app

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues
1. **Signing errors**: Check keystore path and credentials
2. **Code generation errors**: Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner clean` first
3. **Gradle sync issues**: Delete `android/.gradle` folder
4. **Out of memory**: Add `org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4g` to `android/gradle.properties`

### Testing Issues
1. **Google Sign-In not working**: Check SHA-1 fingerprints in Firebase Console
2. **Notifications not working**: Verify FCM configuration
3. **Image upload failing**: Check storage permissions and Supabase policies

## Final Notes

- Always test the release build on real devices before distribution
- Keep the signing key secure and backed up
- Monitor app performance and crash reports after release
- Have a rollback plan ready in case of issues

## Security Reminders

- [ ] Remove all hardcoded secrets/API keys
- [ ] Verify network security configuration
- [ ] Check that debug features are disabled
- [ ] Ensure proper certificate pinning (if implemented)
- [ ] Validate all user inputs properly
